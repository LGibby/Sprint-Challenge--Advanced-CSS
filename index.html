        <h2>Lift Off</h2>

        <p>As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the size of a marble, the most beautiful you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so fragile, so delicate, that if you touched it with a finger it would fall apart. Seeing this has to change a man.</p>

        <h3>Can We Visit Planets?</h3>

        <p>Never in all their history have men been able truly to conceive of the world as one: a single sphere, a globe, having the qualities of a globe, a round earth in which all the directions eventually meet.</p>

        <p>Which there is no center because every point, or none, is center â€” an equal earth which all men occupy as equals. The airman's earth, if free men make it.</p>

            <p>The Earth was small, light blue, and so touchingly alone, our home that must be defended like a holy relic. The Earth was absolutely round.</p>

            <p>Suddenly struck me that that tiny pea, pretty and blue, was the Earth. I put up my thumb and shut one eye, and my thumb blotted out the planet Earth.</p>

<!--Self-Study Questions
Demonstrate your understanding of this week's concepts by answering the following free-form questions.
Edit this document to include your answers after each question. Make sure to leave a blank line above and below your answer so it is clear and easy to read by your project manager

	1. What is the difference between an adaptive website and a fully responsive website?

     Adaptive sites are quick to create like a fixed layout, use breakpoints to accommodate different devices
	Also the design is often divided among desktop, tablet, or phone. Media queries are used just like a responsive but the layout widths are still hard coded at each media query.  Responsive sites combines the features of fixed, adaptive and fluid such as percentage widths, flexible box layouts, some pixels. The design is often divided among desktop, tablet, or phone, with the holy advent of LESS/SCSS/SASS we can nest media queries right in with their target, additionally, responsive units are used throughout the site such as rem, em, percentage, viewport height, viewport width.

	2. Describe what it means to be mobile first vs desktop first.

	mobile first: make it fit a phone/tablet/wearable device and work up from there. desktop first: start with a nifty full screen desktop layout that big-boss approved and then make it fit the little people.f

	3. What does font-size: 62.5% in the html tag do for us when using rem units?

	based on a 16px default browser font size, setting the HTML to 62.5% creates a base of 10px so all percentage in the children then work off of that measurement.(after an exhaustive search I couldn't find an actual conversion ration that could be used with any default browser font size, i.e. what if we started with 20, 22 or even just 18px?)

	4. How would you describe preprocessing to someone new to CSS?

	Nonsense... just kidding, I would say that pre-processing is something that happens after we've written our CSS in another dialect, be that SCSS, SASS, LESS, Stylus, PostCSS whatever, and writing it in that dialect allows us to concisely write reusable blocks of what will turn into vanilla CSS upon preprocessing. We can create style templates so to speak called mixins that contain colors, font sizes, border radius for a button, background colors. Ee can write functions called parametric mixins where we pass @arguments to them for use later and in different ways throughout a page. It ultimately allows us less data entry, which translates into fewer CSS errors later, cleaner code and something that's reusable for branding and marketing purposes also. It's difficult to learn, it's going to seem foreign if you're used to vanilla CSS but ultimately it will benefit all of your projects.

	5. What is your favorite concept in preprocessing? What is the concept that gives you the most trouble?

	All of it is my favorite but all of it gives me the most trouble because there just aren't enough outside study resources to reinforce LESS, but I've witnessed plenty for SASS, SCSS, PostCSS.
